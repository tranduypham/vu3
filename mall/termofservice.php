                    <h3>1. Delivery Charge </h3>
                    <p>A delivery charge will be added to your total payment for each item brought to you or, for
                        multiple items in your order if they are available from the same store. A combined delivery
                        charge for items ordered from multiple stores is not available at this time. From time to time,
                        we may choose to change the rate of the delivery charge and such changes are effective when we
                        display the adjusted rate in your shopping cart. All costs and charges are quoted in U.S.
                        Dollars. You are responsible for paying all charges and any applicable taxes associated with the
                        Service in a timely manner with a valid payment method (currently major credit cards or your
                        PayPal account). If your payment method fails, we may collect charges owed using other
                        collection mechanisms.
                    </p>
                </li>

                    <h3> 2. Information Provided by a Seller</h3>
                    <p>You acknowledge that, in connection with the Service, any information regarding item
                        availability, a seller's return policy ("Seller's Return Policy") and customer support contact
                        information (together, the "Seller's Information") are provided solely by the seller selling on
                        Buyal (the "Seller").

                        Seller (and not Buyal) is responsible for any customer support and returns as part of the
                        Service. Seller may post the Seller's Information on the "Description" section of each Seller
                        listing or on the Seller's Buyal Store on the Site. You are responsible for reviewing the
                        Seller's Information and contacting Seller regarding any information that may not be stated on
                        the Site, including any information about a Seller's return policy, prior to confirming purchase
                        of the item you wish to buy on the Site. Buyal does not make any representation and is not
                        liable
                        for and disclaims any and all responsibility for any content or information relating to Seller
                        Information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Ordering Products</h3>
                    <p>When you place an order and select Buyal Now as your delivery method, you may be called to
                        confirm
                        details of your order and your delivery address. Your phone number will not be shared with the
                        valet, but Buyal or its service providers may store your phone number to provide customer
                        service
                        to you in connection with your order. We will not share your phone number with non-affiliated
                        third parties for their purposes without your consent, but may share your phone numbers with our
                        Family of Companies (i.e., companies that are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Buyal Inc. or
                        are otherwise related to Buyal through common ownership or control) or with our service
                        providers, such as billing or collections companies, who may contact you in a manner consistent
                        with the Buyal Privacy Notice or Buyal User Agreement. Standard telephone minute charges may
                        apply
                        if we contact you.

                        The display of any items in the Site as being Service-eligible at a particular time does not
                        imply or warrant that these items will be available for delivery at any time. We reserve the
                        right to determine, and change from time to time for any reason, the local merchants, and amount
                        and types of their inventory, included in the Service. Delivery times are not guaranteed and may
                        vary, including but not limited to variations due to the following factors: proximity to the
                        store, size of order, how busy stores are, traffic, and high volume of concurrent orders.

                        Delivery addresses must be within the boundaries of a city (or parts of a city) in which we
                        offer the Service. Upon the valet's arrival at the specified delivery address, you will be
                        responsible for ensuring that the valet will be able to make an in-person delivery to you (e.g.,
                        opening locked gates, enabling entry into secured access buildings, leaving instructions for
                        receptionists, etc.). We are not responsible, and will have no liability, for failing to
                        complete a delivery in the event that the delivery address you provide is incorrect, incomplete
                        or inaccessible.

                        We may require a minimum purchase for an order to be Service-eligible. We may change the amount
                        of the minimum purchase requirement (if any) from time to time for any reason, including but not
                        limited to temporary changes for promotional events or new services, and such changes are
                        effective when we display the temporary promotional event or new service on the Site.

                        Your acceptance of the item from the valet shall be prima facie evidence of the undamaged
                        condition of the item at the time of delivery, with the exception of any hidden or latent
                        product defects.

                        It is your responsibility to ascertain and comply with all local, state, federal and
                        international laws (including minimum age requirements) applicable to your possession, use and
                        sale of any item purchased through the Service. By placing an order, you represent and warrant
                        that the items ordered will not be used for illegal purposes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Tax and Title</h3>
                    <p>Tax is charged at the store location for taxable items you purchase. Buyal does not take title to
                        any item(s) you order. Rather, title to the item(s) and risk of loss will pass to you upon the
                        valet's purchase of the item(s) from a local merchant. Any item replacement or other protection
                        provided to you by the merchant or Buyal for damage or loss that may occur during the delivery
                        is
                        offered as a matter of customer service only and is not intended to alter the transfer of title.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>5. Cancellation, Returns and Declined Orders</h3>
                    <p>No buyer-initiated order cancellations are permitted at this time.

                        You are responsible for reviewing a Seller's return policy prior to purchasing an item on the
                        Site. All item returns are handled by Seller and not Buyal and are subject to Seller's return
                        policy, as may be stated on the Seller's Buyal Store site or in the "Description" section of
                        each
                        Seller listing.

                        For Sellers who require in-store returns, return of a purchased item shall be made in person at
                        the Seller's physical store. You are responsible for bringing the receipt or confirmation of
                        purchase of the item to the Seller's store when returning an item.

                        Some Sellers will allow a refund for an item returned to a local store in person. If a Seller
                        allows an in-store refund of a returned item that was purchased using PayPal as the original
                        payment method, upon acceptance by such Seller of your return and notice of such return by
                        Seller to Buyal, Buyal shall refund to your PayPal account the monies paid by you for the item
                        you
                        purchased. PayPal refunds are generally processed within 2 business days of our receipt of
                        notification of the returned item, but please allow up to 2 weeks for funds to be returned to
                        you. Buyal shall not be responsible for any refunds to you if Buyal does not receive a
                        confirmation from Seller of the return of your purchased item.

                        Some Sellers may allow returns for in-store credit only or refunds via another method as stated
                        on the Seller's return policy. Exchanges may be processed as a return or pursuant to the
                        Seller's policy on exchanges, if any.

                        After you accept delivery of your purchased item(s), you will not be entitled to a refund of
                        charges paid for the Service in the event that you elect to return or exchange those item(s).

                        If you choose to submit a Buyal Money Back Guarantee claim for an item delivered via the
                        Service, you agree to first try to return the product in accordance with the Seller's Return
                        Policy and only submit such Buyal Money Back Guarantee claim if Seller fails to process your
                        return or rejects your return. The acceptance of or willingness to accept a return by a Seller
                        for an exchange or store credit in lieu of a refund will not be deemed a failure by the Seller
                        to process your return or a rejection of your return. All Buyal Money Back Guarantee claims will
                        be reviewed and processed in accordance with Buyal's Money Back Guarantee policy.

                        We reserve the right to decline your order at any time for any reason, including, without
                        limitation, if the item is not available at the local merchant, not as described on the Site, in
                        excess of our weight limits, shaped or sized so as to make delivery by a valet impracticable, or
                        if the valet is unable to complete delivery of an order on the first or subsequent attempts. In
                        these hopefully rare instances, you will be called either to inform you that the order has been
                        declined or to inquire as to whether you would like delivery of an alternative item, the item at
                        a different price, or other applicable variations. In the event that your order is declined by
                        Buyal, you will be refunded any amounts you paid as a Delivery Charge.

                    <h3>6.Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>We cannot guarantee continuous access to the Buyal Now Service, and the operation of the Buyal
                        Now
                        Service may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control, including, without
                        limitation, natural hazards or disasters, extreme weather conditions, acts of terrorism, failure
                        of telecommunications systems and other conditions outside of our control. Accordingly, to the
                        extent legally permitted, we disclaim all warranties, terms and conditions, in each case either
                        express or implied, applicable to the Service. Further, to the extent legally permitted, we
                        disclaim all warranties, terms and conditions, in each case either express or implied, with
                        respect to items purchased by you through our Buyal Now Service, including, without limitation,
                        disclaiming any liability for product defect or failure, claims that are due to normal wear,
                        product misuse, abuse, product modification, improper product selection, non-compliance with any
                        codes, or misappropriation. We are not responsible for any actions or omissions of third
                        parties, including, without limitation, acts of public authorities, criminal activity, strikes,
                        local or civil unrest, commotions or disputes. We are not liable for any loss of money, goodwill
                        or reputation, or any special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages arising, directly or
                        indirectly, out of your use of or your inability to use our Buyal Now Services or the items you
                        purchased through our Buyal Now Service. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of
                        warranties or exclusion of damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to
                        you.

                        You agree that your sole remedy, if any, for problems with items you purchased through the Buyal
                        Now Service is to seek a return and refund for such item in accordance with the Cancellation,
                        Returns, and Declined Orders section above.

                        Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to
                        any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the total charges (under the Fees section) you
                        paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, and (b) $100.

                        and employees) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by
